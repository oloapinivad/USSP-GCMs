We will check some of the most important fields that constitues the surface and top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) radiation budget, and we will do this by analyising the data from one climate simulation from the EC-Earth3 Global Climate Model. Again, data from the historical simulation will be analysed, but this time we will use yearly averaged data (again interpolated on a regular grid). Again, please note that this preprocessing operations have been all done with [CDO](https://code.mpimet.mpg.de/projects/cdo)."

It is very important thus to determinate the contribution of the cloud to the radiative budget. This can be easily done by estimating the CRF, the cloud radiative forcing. In real world this is not extremely easy, but in model is fairly simple since radiative schemes of climate models also save the so-called clear-sky variables, which are variables were the radiative computation is done in the ideal configuration where no cloud are present.
