    "# Analysis of some Paleoclimate model data\n",
    "\n",
    "*Paolo Davini (2024)*\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook aims at illustrating a simple analysis of paleoclimate simulations, part of the [PMIP](https://pmip.lsce.ipsl.fr/) project, that probably many of you already know much better than me! We take data from one specific climate model, namely the AWI-ESM-1 Earth System Model. To simplify the analysis and increase the amount of data available we interpolated everything to 2x2 degree grid, and perform climatological mean so that you will have only one record per variable! Some operations indeed can be computationally heavy, and we cannot run them on a cloud jupyter notebook :-) "
